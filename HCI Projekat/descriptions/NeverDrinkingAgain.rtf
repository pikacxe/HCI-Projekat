Wiz Khalifa's new song #NeverDrinkingAgain is about slipping up and breaking his sobriety.In the song, he sings
 "It be like two shots then I'm loaded 
  Then them two shots turn to 40
  Then I wake up in the morning
  Like
  How did I slip up?
  When I said I wasn't drinking again"
The song was released on December 30th, 2022 and it reflects on a wild night of drinking and his urge of sobriety.
